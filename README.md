**Researcher, Educator, Indie Game Developer**

I am exploring the intersection of Art & Technology, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence through my academic work. This diverse educational background has given me a deep interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on engaging users and motivating them in video games and Mixed Reality (MR) environments.

My involvement in various projects and teaching roles has equipped me with solid technical skills and the ability to solve problems creatively. I've received recognition for my work, which I appreciate, but I also recognize the importance of continuous learning. I am excited to keep exploring and expanding my expertise.
